# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Sam’s research to date has been concerned with the design optimization and multiphysics computational model development of industrial scale materials processing systems in collaboration with 3M with the goal of studying material throughput, quality, system efficiency, process, and direct emissions. He further studies the mitigation of environmentally and societelly harmful combustion systems through the development of field-scale-deployable, accurate physical models that interface with advanced flow measurement diagnostics. Models developed to date have examined multifidelity approaches to capturing and describing molecular diffusion and mixing phenomena in fire scenarios as well as methane emission, destruction, and dispersion in polluting flaring systems. Sam incorporates modal decompositions and reduced order flow models that capture spatial and temporal dynamics from chemically and physically detailed simulations, and can be used in a computationally efficient framework to model large scale systems at industrial and weather scales.
